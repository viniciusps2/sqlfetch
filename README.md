# Name
Tool to extract data structure from an SQL database

# Description
As a developer solving bugs in production, mainly related to data in a SQL database, it's a real struggle to reproduce the exact scenario in my machine to debug correctly. But it's not easy to copy data from the production database to your local machine, you need to copy the SQL statements in the exact sequence, according to the relationship between the tables. 

Then I thought to create a tool that allowed me to just configure the tables and the relationship, execute it on the production machine, copy the SQL statements, and then execute on my machine to create the same data structure.

        "configuration": [ 
            {"id" : "1", "cc_code": "XPTO"}
        ]
    }
]
